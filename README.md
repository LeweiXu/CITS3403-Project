# CITS3403-Project

An application to track your media consumption habits.

Upon consumption of media (or maybe at the end of the day), users can input what media they consumed, the fields are:

1. Type of media e.g. game, tv show, anime, movie, novel, manga. This field should be very fine grained, and the user should select from multiple predefined options

2. Name of media e.g. elden ring

3. Duration, exact granularity to be decided

4. Date, should default to current date

Users should also be able to upload a csv file with 4 columns corresponding to the above fields. The app should also be able to export users data in the same csv format.

Analysis:
The app should give insights on overall media consumption from week to week (or month to month, granularity can be selected by the user)
The app should also give insights on media consumption for specific types of media e.g. how long did a user spend playing video games from week to week.
The app should also give summary data e.g. how long did the user spend watching movies in the past 6 months
The app should generate visual graphs for the user as well.

Future ideas: 
1. Ratings for media consumed
